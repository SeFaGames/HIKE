Klimawandern ist nicht nur eine Gelegenheit, die besondere Natur im Harz zu erleben, sondern auch eine effektive Methode, die körperliche und geistige Gesundheit zu fördern.

Ab hier folgen wir auf einer alten Bahntrasse der „Bode\" flussaufwärts. An einer markanten Granitbrücke überqueren wir diese und gehen nun an der anderen Bachseite bis hinauf zu den Bodewasserfällen. Granitblöcke säumen den weiteren Verlauf bis zur Schutzhütte an der „Bärenbrücke\". Hier biegen wir rechts ab und steigen nun mäßig steil aber stetig den Südhang des Wurmbergs empor bis zum ehemaligen Granit-Steinbruch. Wir werden mit Ausblicken über die Harzer Berge belohnt. Das Gasthaus „Rodelhaus\" lädt hier am höchsten Punkt der Tour zur Rast, bevor der Abstieg über den „Bremkerbornweg\" zurück nach Braunlage führt. Nach Überquerung der Bundesstraße gelangen wir zum Oberen Kurpark und von dort über einen Parkweg wieder an den Ausgangspunkt, wo Outdoor-Fitnessgeräte und das Kneippbecken einen passenden Abschluss der Route bilden.","publicTransit":"<p>Braunlage liegt im Zentrum des Harzes und ist über mehrere Bus-Linien aus allen Himmelsrichtungen erreichbar.</p>\n<div id=\"gtx-trans\" style=\"position:
