NN). Über die mehr als 1000 Jahre alten Felstreppenstufen erklimmen Sie den Gipfel des Großen Treppensteins, von dem Sie einen wunderbaren Ausblick<br/>über das Okertal genießen können. Die Stempelstelle Nr. 117 (Treppenstein) der Harzer Wandernadel befindet sich gleich am Weg. Im Schatten der Tannen können Sie sich hier eine kleine Ruhepause gönnen, bevor Sie weiter in Richtung Kästeklippen wandern. In der Nähe finden Sie das Restaurant Kästehaus mit einer weiteren Stempelstelle Nr. 118 (Kästehaus). An der unterhalb des Kästehauses befindlichen Gesteinsformation Hexenküche vorüber gelangen Sie über die Mausefalle zur Feigenbaumklippe. Hier führt der Weg über den Kleinen Romke zum Romkerhaller Wasserweg.
