Rechts von uns, auf der anderen Talseite, liegt der mächtige und für seine Mineralvielfalt bekannte Gabbro-Streinbruch. Am Radau-Wasserfall bietet sich eine idyllisch gelegene Einkehrmöglichkeit - sie lädt uns ein zu einer ersten Rast. Weiter wandern wir an der Schwefelquelle vorbei und durch das reizvolle Radautal zu einer weiteren Quelle, der Basteborn-Quelle. Über den Salzstieg gelangen wir schließlich zum bekannten Torfhaus und haben die Hälfte unserer Tour geschafft. Hier können wir auf dem dazugehörigen Platz das Nationalparkdenkmal bewundern, ein Kunstwerk aus Harzer Gesteinen, das Nationalpark Besucherzentrum Torfhaus besuchen oder gemütlich Einkehren. Unser Blick schweift über die umliegenden Wälder und den Brocken - ein herrliches Panorama! Die zweite große Etappe führt uns über die Skiwiese zum Skidenkmal und über den Pionierweg zur Eckertalsperre. Auch hier verwöhnt uns die Landschaft wieder mit fantastischen Aussichten. Ein kleiner Gang auf die Sperrmauer bietet sich an, um das Wunderwerk der Technik zu bestaunen. Die Gaststätte Molkenhaus stellt unseren nächsten Halt dar: Wie ein uriges Hexenhäuschen schaut sie aus, und an einem kleinen See gelegen ist sie der ideale Punkt für die nächste Pause. Über die Alte Rodelbahn gelangen wir schließlich zurück zum Kurpark.</p>","gettingThere":"<p>Anfahrt auf der B4 bis nach Bad Harzburg</p>","parking":"<p>Gebührenpflichtige öffentliche Parkplätze am
