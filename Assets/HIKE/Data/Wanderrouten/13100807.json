Auf dem Schalker Grabenweg entdecken Sie kurz vor Festenburg einen der seltenen Lochsteine (Grubenfeldbegrenzungssteine) aus dem Jahre 1752.\n<p> </p>","directions":"Ausgangspunkt der Wanderung ist die Stabkirche in Hahnenklee. Am langen Treppenaufgang zur Kirche weist ein Wegeschild in Richtung Festenburg „5G blaues Kreuz“. Sie folgen und kommen direkt auf den Schalker Grabenweg, der Sie über den Damm des Mittleren Grumbacher Teichs führt. Sie wandern den Weg weiter Richtung Clausthal Zellerfeld durch den Fichtenwald, dabei überqueren Sie die L 516 bis Sie der Weg an die B241 bringt. Sie gehen vom Parkplatz aus über die Straße und steigen schräg gegenüber in den Wanderweg „5 G Blaues Kreuz“ erneut ein.  Auf dem schmalen Waldpfad laufen Sie am Großen Kellerhalsteich vorbei, spazieren über den Damm und hinter dem Teich, ein Stück bergauf, treffen Sie schließlich auf den Oberen Schalker Graben. Dieser Weg verläuft nach rechts, am Südhang des Kahlen Berges entlang. Sie folgen dem Pfad bis zu einer kleinen Brücke und gehen weiter gerade aus in den Wald hinein vorbei am so genannten Lochstein (Stempelstelle 126).  Kurz vor Festenburg verlassen Sie den Schalker Graben und wandern rechts den Berg hinab zur Waldgaststätte Grüne Tanne. Sie gehen über den Hof der Gaststätte, an dessen Ende der Wanderweg  „5J blauer Punkt“ beginnt. Dieser stetig ansteigende Weg führt Sie auf die 762 Meter hohe Schalke (Stempelstelle 125). Hinunter benutzen Sie die Zufahrtsstraße „5D grünes Dreieck“ bis zum Auerhahn. Danach passieren Sie die Bundesstraße B241 und erreichen den Oberen Auerhahnweg, eine breite Forststraße (1E roter Punkt im Dreieck), auf der Sie zurück nach Hahnenklee-Bockswiese und zur Stabkirche gelangen.","publicTransit":"RBB Bus: Linie 830  Goslar - Hahnenklee - Cl.-Zellerfeld <br/>RBB Bus: Linie 832 Goslar - Langelsheim - Wolfshagen (Lautenthal - Hahnenklee)\n<p>Haltestelle: Hahnenklee
