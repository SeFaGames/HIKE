Erleben Sie das Niedersächsische Bergbaumuseum in Lautenthal und fahren Sie mit einer Grubenbahn tief in die historische Silbergrube „Lautenthals Glück“ hinein. Eine Bootsfahrt im Berg in einem Wasserstollen wird Ihnen unvergesslich bleiben.\n<p> </p>","directions":"Die Wanderung zum Maaßener Gaipel beginnt am Wandertreff am Kurhaus in Hahnenklee. Zunächst laufen Sie in Richtung Minigolfplatz und folgen dann der Lautenthaler Straße bis ganz zum Ende. An dem ehemaligen Hotel Am Waldgarten führt Sie ein schmaler Trampelpfad über den Ringweg zum Fuckelweg. Dieser bringt Sie leicht abwärts auf die Hahnenkleer Bergstraße. Folgen Sie der Straße bis zur L 516. Überqueren Sie die Landstraße und gehen Sie etwa 100 m auf dem Sägemühlenweg, bis Sie rechter Hand das Hinweisschild zum Weg „1R roter Punkt im Dreieck“ sehen. Diesem Weg folgend erreichen Sie den Kranichsweg. Die Forststraße verläuft am Nordhang des Kranichsberges mit einem leichten Gefälle bis zum Maaßener Gaipel (Stempelstelle 107) entlang. Nach einer Pause gehen Sie zurück auf den Kranichsweg, biegen in diesen rechts ein und gelangen nach 100 Metern zu einer Weggabelung. An ihr gehen Sie in den linken Rotkreuzweg (breiter Forstweg). Auf diesem 4 km langen, stetig ansteigenden Weg (Achtung: kaum Ruhepausen möglich!) wandern Sie bis zum Sägemühlenweg, in den Sie links einbiegen. An dieser Kreuzung finden Sie auch eine Hütte des Harzklubs als Unterstellmöglichkeit. Der Sägemühlenweg führt Sie zurück zur Hahnenkleer Bergstraße und vorbei an der Schutzhütte Gottlob. Sie nehmen erneut schräg rechts den Fuckelweg und kommen – immer mit Blick auf den Bocksberg“ – innerhalb weniger Augenblicke auf den oberen Teil der Lautenthaler Straße in Hahnenklee an. Nach wenigen Minuten erreichen Sie den Ausgangspunkt der Wanderung.","publicTransit":"RBB Bus: Linie 830  Goslar - Hahnenklee - Cl.-Zellerfeld <br/>RBB Bus: Linie 832 Goslar - Langelsheim - Wolfshagen
