Ausgangspunkt ist der Parkplatz im Hellegrund von dem aus wir entsprechend der Hinweisschilder alsbald in nördlicher Richtung durch den „Hartlah“ wandern. Ein schmaler von Fichten gesäumter Pfad mündet auf einen Waldweg dem wir in nord-östl. Richtung folgen bis zur Waldkante. Hier genießen wir den BlicK auf die Orte Wöllersheim und Neuhof sowie das bergige Waldgebiet der „Harplage“.</p>\r\n<p>Weiter geht es nach links, also in westlicher Richtung, durch ein Tal und wieder aufwärts am Waldrand entlang bis zum Zielpunkt. Hier sollte man die Hinweistafel lesen und auf einer Bank unter Fichten eine Rast einlegen. Zurück entweder den gleichen Weg oder an der gegenüberliegenden Waldkante unterhalb des \"Sauberge\" bis zur K317. Nach ca. 100m auf der Kreisstraße Richtung Wöllersheim geht man rechts einen Feldweg bergan bis zur Waldkante. Weiter geht es dann in südlicher Richtung im Wald bzw. an der Waldkante entlang, an einem stillgelegten Steinbruch vorbei, leicht ansteigend ,auf einem Holzsteg über einen Graben und durch einen überwachsenen Pfad bis zum folgenden Waldrandweg. Auf diesem schreiten wir voran bis wir unseren Ausgangspunkt den Hellegrund wieder erreicht haben.</p>\r\n<p>Es empfiehlt sich die Lamspringer Wander- & Freizeitkarte  als Orientierungshilfe mitzunehmen. </p>"},"point":[10.005156,51.971715,246.0],"labels":["top"],"primaryRegion":{"type":"tourismarea","id":"1027334","title":"Weserbergland"},"regions":[{"type":"commune","id":"802542873"},{"type":"country","id":"1022089"},{"type":"district","id":"1022293"},{"type":"province","id":"1022093"},{"type":"tourismarea","id":"37890873"},{"type":"tourismarea","id":"1027334"}],"coordinates":[{"title":"DD","type":"dd","value":"51.971715,
