Dem Natur suchenden Wanderer erschließt sich eine Landschaft, die durch und durch von Menschenhand geprägt wurde, nachdem vor wahrscheinlich drei Jahrtausenden am Rammelsberg erstmals Erz gefunden worden war. Nach dem Ende des Bergbaus 1988 gerieten auch dessen Spuren aus dem Blick und wurden von der für Bergbaufolgelandschaften charakteristischen Flora allmählich überdeckt. Die Tour bietet Naturerlebnis in einer uralten Kulturlandschaft und lässt sich in drei Stunden bequem bewältigen.","directions":"Von der Domvorhalle direkt am Kaiserpfalzparkplatz gehen Sie entlang der Stadtbefestigung zu den Wiesen am alten Bergdorf. Die Tour führt von dort hinauf zum Maltermeisterturm am Rammelsberg – heute ein beliebtes Ausflugslokal. Weiter geht es über den Schmiedeweg hinab zum ehemaligen Erzbergwerk, das heute ein Museum und Besucherbergwerk ist und zu den herausragendsten Industriedenkmälern zählt. Durch die Rammelsberger Straße mit ihren Bergmannshäusern gelangen Sie ins alte Bergmannsviertel am Frankenberg und zurück zum Parkplatz an der Kaiserpfalz.","publicTransit":"Stadtbus
