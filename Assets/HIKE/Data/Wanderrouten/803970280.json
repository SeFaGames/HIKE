Dieses Ökosystem wird heute mit Mitteln des Naturschutzes oder durch landwirtschaftliche Nutzung aufrecht er-halten. Mit Beginn der Besiedlung durch Bergleute ab Ende des 12. Jahrhunderts entstanden die Bergwiesen durch Kahlschläge und anschließende private Nutzung der Flächen für Viehweiden und Winterfuttergewinnung. Damals hatte fast jeder Haushalt in Buntenbock zur Selbstversorgung Rotvieh und/oder Ziegen. Die Tiere des Dorfes wurden von Hirten gesammelt und im Frühjahr, bzw. nach der Heuernte auf die Wiesen getrieben. Über den Rest der Weidesaison wurde Wald-Weidewirtschaft betrieben.</p>\r\n<p>An den wunderschönen Bergwiesen können Sie heute entspannen: Auf einem Spaziergang auf dem aus mehreren Rund-touren bestehenden und gut ausgeschilderten „Buntenbocker Bergwiesenweg“ entdecken Sie sattgrüne und mit unzähligen bunt blühenden Blumen überzogene Wiesen und Hänge und lassen sich vom Duft der Natur verzaubern. Wunderbare Ausblicke auf die umliegenden Höhenzüge und auf stille Seen und Teiche, die Teil des UNESCO Weltkulturerbes Oberharzer Wasserwirtschaft sind, warten auf Sie! Der „Buntenbocker Bergwiesenweg“ ist ein Naturschutz-Projekt des Harzklub-Zweigvereins Buntenbock, das mit Unter-stützung durch die Hermann-Reddersen-Stiftung des Harzklubs und private Spenden realisiert wurde.</p>","parking":"<p>Parkplatz am Kurpark Buntenbock schräg ggü. der Feuerwache</p>","startingPoint":"Am Kurpark Buntenbock","additionalInformation":"<p>Tourist-Information
