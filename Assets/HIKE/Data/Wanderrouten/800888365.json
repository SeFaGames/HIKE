Wir umrunden den Großen und Kleinen Wurzelnberg, folgen dabei der Verlorenen Kulmke. Nördliche des Kleinen Wurzelnberges bzw. östlich der Verlorenen Ecke erreichen wir einen alten Rotbuchenwald. Dort weitet sich das FFH-Gebiet. Alte Laubwälder weisen eine erstaunliche Vielfalt auf. Mit etwas Glück entdecken wir also die eine oder andere, für Laubwälder typische Vogelart wie den Schwarzspecht oder den seltenen Schwarzstorch. An einem verregneten Tag läuft uns vielleicht sogar ein „Regenmännchen“ über den Weg. So werden im Harz Feuersalamander genannt, denn die verlassen bei Trockenheit nur nachts ihre Verstecke. Am Schmierplatz erreichen wir an der Grenze zum Nationalpark Harz den höchsten Punkt unserer Wanderung (672,3 m über NHN). Zurück geht’s durchs Kratztal bis ins Tal der Großen Kulmke. Am Zusammenfluss von Großer und Kleiner Kulmke sind 392 m über NHN erreicht. Bis zum Ausgangspunkt unserer Wanderung ist der Höhenunterschied dann nicht mehr groß. Nach etwa 2 km mündet die Kulmke bei gut 350 m über NHN in die Sieber. Die wiederum mündet im Harzvorland (Hattorf) in die Oder, die Oder schließlich bei Katlenburg in die Rhume.</p>","startingPoint":"Bushaltestelle Sieber Odersieber (Buslinie 451) oder der
