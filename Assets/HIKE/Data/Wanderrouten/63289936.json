Der Rundwanderweg führt zu sechs für die Südharzer Landschaft typischen Lebensräumen.</p>\r\n<p>Blühende Wiesen, artenreiche Trockenrasen und beeindruckende Wälder prägen diese Wanderung. Rode-Siedlungen werden hier am Südharz in die Zeit der inneren Kolonisation, in das 9./10. Jh. eingeordnet. Schöne Fachwerkbauten und große alte Bäume prägen das Ortsbild, in dem das alte Handwerk der Besenbinderei noch heute gepflegt wird. Vom Ort Hainrode aus gehen viele Wanderwege in die Umgebung. Die Frühjahrshochwässer des Hainröder Baches dringen in meist trockene Bachschwinden ein und beleben alte Erdfälle. Die Kupferschieferhalden in der Hainröder Flur bieten mit ihrem schwermetallreichen Verwitterungsboden einigen seltenen spezialisierten Pflanzen Wachstumsgrundlage. Sie können deshalb als wertvolle Kleinbiotope angesehen werden.
