Von hier aus folgen wir dem ausgeschilderten Kaiserweg bis zum Molkenhaus: Wir bewundern die Statue des Hl. Antonius auf gleichnamigen Platz, passieren die Säperstelle und verweilen kurz am Sachsenbrunnen. Über den Echoplatz (Wir rufen in die Welt hinaus...) gelangen wir dann zur Gaststätte \"Molkenhaus. Das pittoreske Häuschen und die idyllische Lage am See verlangen eine längere Rast. Ausgeruht wandern wir weiter auf Kaisers Spuren bis zum Grenzweg. Über den Abstieg Abbetränke gelangen wir zum Grottenklippenweg, der eine herrliche Aussicht auf die Umgebung bietet. Die nächsten sehenswerten Stationen unserer Wanderung sind die Schwefelquelle und der Radau-Wasserfall. Hier bietet sich auch die nächste Einkehrmöglichkeit. Auf dem Philosophenweg wandern wir schließlich Richtung Kurpark zurück - nicht aber, ohne linker Hand einen Blick auf den Gabbro-Steinbruch zu werfen.</p>","gettingThere":"<p>Anfahrt auf der A395,
