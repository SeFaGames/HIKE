Folgen Sie dazu am Parkplatz \"Unter den Linden“ einfach dem Taubenstieg Richtung Steinberg. Alle kleinen Wanderer können sich hier so richtig austoben. Dazu gibt es einen wunderschönen Blick über die Goslarer Bergwiesen und Goslar.\r\n<p> </p>","directions":"Die Wanderung beginnt in der Fußgängerzone (Rathausstraße). Zunächst begeben Sie sich in Richtung Stabkirche. Vor dem Großparkplatz an der Stabkirche, vorbei an dem Ferienhaus Parkresidenz an der Stabkirche  biegen Sie auf dem Gehweg nach links auf den Wanderweg „2G blauer Punkt“ ein. Sie überqueren die Skipiste und laufen auf dem Hahnenkleer Weg bzw. dem „Vogellehrpfad“ bis zum ersten Abzweig. Am Abzweig nehmen Sie die leicht bergab laufende Forststraße Wilddiebsweg und folgen dieser, sich immer rechtshaltend, am Schlepplift vorbei bis Sie erneut auf den „Vogellehrpfad“ treffen.  Am Windsattel angekommen wandern Sie rund um den Töberschekopf , der Sie nach mehreren Kehren zum Graneblockhaus (Stempelstelle 111) und dem Oberen Klippenweg (2F roter Punkt) führt. Diesem Wanderweg folgen Sie vorbei an den Magaretenklippen bis zum Parkplatz Unter den Linden, bei dem Sie wieder auf den eigentlichen Weg über den Taubenstieg treffen. Die tollen Blicke auf den Granestausee verkürzen die Wanderzeit bis zum beliebten Parkplatz Unter den Linden. Nach dem Überqueren des Parkplatzes bringt Sie die Teerstraße hinauf am alten Forsthaus Königsberg vorbei. Etwas später biegen Sie in den rechts abzweigenden Wanderweg „2G blauer Punkt“ ein. Mit einem sehr schönen Blick über die Goslarer Bergwiesen erreichen Sie den Frankenberger Teich und gelangen über den Claustor- und den Vititorwall ins Zentrum von Goslar.","publicTransit":"RBB Bus:
