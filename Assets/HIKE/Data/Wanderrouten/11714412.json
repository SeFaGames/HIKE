Spannende Einblicke in das Thema Wasser bietet eine Ausstellung der Harzwasserwerke, die sich im Wasserwerk an der Staumauer befindet. Der gesamte Weg ist asphaltiert oder geschottert und hat nur leichte Steigungen. Unterwegs kommen Sie an der Astfelder Hütte, an der Dittmarsberg-Quelle, an der Wethberg-Hütte, an einer weiteren Schutzhütte und an der Stempelstelle<br/>Nr. 110 (Granestausee) der Harzer Wandernadel vorbei. Von dort haben Sie eine tolle Sicht auf die Granetalsperre mit der Staumauer. Eine riesige Wasserlandschaft erstreckt sich hinter dem 600 Meter langen Staudamm der Granetalsperre. Bis zu 46,4 Mio. m³ Wasser lassen sich in der 1969 fertiggestellten Talsperre speichern, die von den Harzwasserwerken zur Trinkwasserversorgung weiter Teile Niedersachsens genutzt
