Etappe vom Kloster Wöltingerode bis Kloster Ilsenburg.</p>","long":"<p>Diese 20 km lange Etappe des Klosterwanderwegs ist landschaftlich und historisch besonders reizvoll, wird doch die ehemalige innerdeutsche Grenze überschritten. Von Kloster Wöltingerode aus führt jetzt der Klosterwanderweg in Halbhanglage über den Hercyniaweg am Höhenzug des Harly entlang. Ortsbezeichnungen erinnern an das Kalibergwerk, das hier bis 1930 in Betrieb war. Danach führt ein romantischer Pfad an der Oker entlang nach Wiedelah, einem Ortsteil von Vienenburg. Von dort an verläuft der Klosterwanderweg auf dem Grünen Band, der ehemaligen innerdeutschen Grenze entlang. Auf der Etappe geht es dann weiter durch die Feldmark bis Abbenrode, danach durch den Schimmerwald nach Stapelburg. <br />Es folgt eine besonders idyllische Wegstrecke entlang der Ecker bis zum Wiesengelände der ehemaligen Kureinrichtung Jungborn. Über den Ilsenburger Stieg geht es weiter Richtung Ilsenburg. Dort folgt man der Kastanienallee und gelangt durch den Kurpark und vorbei am See zum Marktplatz. Von dort führt der Weg aufwärts zum Kloster Ilsenburg. Die romanische Klosteranlage liegt heute inmitten eines romantischen Schlossparks.</p>","publicTransit":"<p>Bahn: Goslar-Vienenburg-Ilsenburg</p>\r\n<p>Bus: Abbenrode-Ilsenburg-Wernigerode</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://pdf.hvb-harz.de/downloads/regio_wr/18/270.pdf\">pdf.hvb-harz.de/downloads/regio_wr/18/270.pdf </a></p>","gettingThere":"Bhf Goslar, Vienenburg, Ilsenburg.","parking":"Parkmöglichkeit an beiden Klöstern.","startingPoint":"Vienenburg (Kloster Wöltingerode)","safetyGuidelines":"<p>Keine besonderen Schwierigkeiten.
