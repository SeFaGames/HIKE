Diese ehemalige Landesgrenze, die heute Landkreisgrenze ist, wird noch deutlich in den meist gut sichtbaren Grenzsteinen aus Kalk- oder Buntsandstein. Diese sind tief im Erdboden verankert und tragen auf der Hildesheimer/Hannoverschen Seite die Buchstaben B (Bistum Hildesheim oder KH (Königreich Hannover) und eine fortlaufende Nummer und auf der braunschweigischen Seite HB (Herzogtum Braunschweig) und eine Wolfsangel sowie eine Nummer. Es gibt auch noch etliche Grenzsteine, die die Bezeichnungen AB für das Hildesheimer Amt Bilderlahe oder AG für das braunschweigische Amt Gandersheim tragen, sowie Grenzsteine mit einem Kelch und einem L für Kloster Lamspringe. Teilweise säumen sogar 2 sich gegenüberstehende Grenzsteine den Grenzweg, die die Grenze „sicherer“ gegen heimliche Grenzverschiebungen machen sollten.
