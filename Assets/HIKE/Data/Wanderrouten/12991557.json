Diese sehr kleine Flussinsel im Oberlauf der Oker liegt zwischen zwei mächtigen Granitblöcken. Sie erreichen diesen romantischen<br/>Flecken über eine Holzbrücke. Hier gibt es gleichzeitig eine der schönsten Wildwasserstrecken in Deutschland. Oberhalb der Verlobungsinsel liegt Romkerhall, ein beliebtes Ausflugsziel mit einem 65 Meter hohen Kunstwasserfall, dem höchsten im Harz. Von Romkerhall aus setzen Sie Ihren Weg über die Alte Harzstraße fort, eine ehemalige wichtige Verkehrsader im Oberharz, und gelangen zurück zum Ausgangspunkt, dem Waldhaus
